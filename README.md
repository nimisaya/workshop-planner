# Workshop Planner

_Note: This project is parked._

## Overview
Ever had to plan a workshop? A retro? Or maybe an entire design sprint? 
Workshop planner saves you from digging in your old files to find that template you vaguely recall using the last time by providing a space to keep track of all your workshop plans. Create your own plans or use the provided plans as a starting point.

### Designs and Database diagrams
[View initial concepts and database diagrams on figma](https://www.figma.com/file/8OF5syt1JJbXythgf36XQv/Workshop-planner?node-id=0%3A1)

## Known bugs

- New tasks are not associated with their relevant workshops due to removal of workshops >-< tasks relationship. Users can still create new tasks and assign them to a workshop. The assignment is not done at the point of creation.
- Time must be entered in seconds when creating a task
- Workshop duration (total_time) must be calculated manually and entered in the database

...and it definitely needs to be refactored...
